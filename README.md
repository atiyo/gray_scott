# Julia Simulations of the Gray-Scott Equations with Spatial Inhomogeneity

The [Gray-Scott](ffmpeg -i video.avi video.gif -hide_banner) system of
equations comprises of two coupled partial differential equations. Small
changes in its parameters can lead to a wide variety of spatial patterns.

To show the variety of behaviour shown by the system, it is natural to vary the
parameters through space and show a full range of behaviours from a single
simulation, as done in this repository.

## Simulation output

Image shown below. A full video is included in `gray_scott.mp4`. Parameters are as in `gray_scott.jl`
